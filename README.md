- What was your experience?
- Quiet a intresting experience. This was a really good challenge.
- What have you learned/improved?
   I learnd about the CSS Media Queries it was a Fun Ride. I stumble upon many erros, But that's the part of the Process.
- Your wisdom? :)
   Keep trying. Don't be afraid of the ERRORS. If you can't think of anything just take a break do something else and come back with a Fresh mind, The Errors will not be as Daunting as they were Before.
